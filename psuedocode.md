The Train Scheduler Homework

This homework combines a few elements from previous activities in class. These activities are:
* week 4/day 2/17-TimeSheet
* week 4/day 3/21-TrainPredictions

// In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.
    We need to create a firebase database at the firebase website
    I assume that the train data will need to be pushed to the firebase within the assignment
    Also, based on the example picture, this website should look just like the TimeSheet activity looks. So I will use that as a base, as our team finished that assignment. 
// Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
    we can use the train prediction activity to manipulate the information
// This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
    What we can put directly into firebase:
        * The name of the train
        * How often they run
        * their destination
    What we need to use MomentJS to calculate:
        * when the train will be arriving next
        * how far away the train is
